# State

Current project: #2 bucketmove (leave MinIO safely: inventory, target check, copy all versions, verify)
Phase: build (milestones 1–3 of 6 done)
Repo: projects/bucketmove/ inside finding-bugs (own repos blocked, see below)
Spec: projects/bucketmove/SPEC.md

## Next step

Milestone 4: `bucketmove copy`. Per bucket: create it on the target (object lock at
creation if source has it and target supports it), versioning, then copy settings
(lifecycle, policy, CORS, bucket tags) that the target supports. Copy every key's
versions oldest first (list versions, group by key, reverse), recreate delete
markers with a plain DELETE on the versioned target, carry content type, cache and
disposition headers, user metadata, object tags, retention and legal hold. Stream
GET→PUT (multipart above 64 MiB). Journal (JSON lines in a state dir) of finished
source version IDs so a re-run continues; write the old→new version ID map. Refuse
when check finds a loss unless --accept-loss. Use s3util.ListVersions everywhere
(Garage has no ListObjectVersions). Integration test: seed MinIO, copy to every
target, compare version chains (order, content hashes, markers, tags, metadata).

## Notes for runs

- The Docker daemon is not running at session start. Start it with
  `sudo dockerd > /tmp/dockerd.log 2>&1 &` and wait a few seconds.
- Integration tests: `MOP_INTEGRATION=1 go test ./...` (label-scoped, safe) or
  `MOP_INTEGRATION=destructive` (unscoped; only on a throwaway daemon like this one).
- The classic image store prunes differently (parent images). To test it, stop
  dockerd and start one with `--feature containerd-snapshotter=false` and a separate
  `--data-root`; the classic-builder tests (DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0) only bite there.
- bucketmove servers: `scripts/test-servers.sh up /tmp/test-servers.env`, then
  `set -a; . /tmp/test-servers.env; set +a; BUCKETMOVE_INTEGRATION=1 go test ./...`.
  MinIO runs with 4 drives (versioning/object lock need erasure coding) and
  MINIO_CI_CD=1. Garage has no versioning, tags, policy, object lock and no
  ListObjectVersions; MinIO has no per-bucket CORS. SeaweedFS and RustFS support all.
- bucketmove test servers: MinIO is not on Docker Hub or reachable registries any
  more; build it with `GOBIN=/tmp/minio-bin go install
  github.com/minio/minio@v0.0.0-20260212201848-7aac2a2c5b7c` (about 2.5 minutes).
  Garage (dxflrs/garage), SeaweedFS (chrislusf/seaweedfs) and RustFS (rustfs/rustfs)
  pull from Docker Hub.
- Docker Hub pulls can fail with 429 (rate limit). Tests must not depend on pulling
  images: build tiny test images locally (e.g. `FROM scratch` with a static file).

## Finished projects

1. **docker-mop** (projects/docker-mop, v1.0.0 at commit 50c1a1e). Docker CLI plugin:
   `plan`/`prune` (exact prune preview, verified against Docker's real prune on both
   image stores) and verified `volume copy`/`rename`. Before making it public the
   owner should: read the README, try `make install` and `docker mop plan` on their
   own machine, check that GitHub Actions ran green on the push, and decide whether
   to give it its own repo (recommended, so `go install` and releases work).

## Blockers for the owner

- Creating new repos fails: the Claude GitHub app gets "403 Resource not accessible
  by integration". To give docker-mop its own repo, create an empty private repo
  `ganeshphutane-g/docker-mop` on GitHub and give the Claude GitHub app access to it
  (GitHub settings > Applications > Claude > Repository access). The next run will
  move the project there with its history.
- Pushing git tags is refused by this environment's git proxy (branch pushes work).
  To mark the release, create tag `docker-mop/v1.0.0` on commit 50c1a1e from the
  GitHub web UI (Releases > Draft a new release), or let the run tag it in the new
  repo once it exists.
