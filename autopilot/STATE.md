# State

Current project: #5 issuemove (move issues between Gitea/Forgejo repositories)
Phase: build, milestone 3 of 4.
- Milestones 1–2 are done: the client, refs, plan and move.
- The move covers issues, comments, labels/milestones (created when missing),
  assignees, due date, state, attachments with UUID rewriting, reactions, Sudo
  authorship or an attribution header, `#n` rewriting outside code, the back-link
  comment, closing and locking the original, and resume by hidden markers (no
  journal file). It also works across instances (users matched by login + email).
- Tests run on real Gitea 1.24.
- Left for milestone 3: issue dependencies, watchers, `plan` saying when an issue
  was already moved, README; then reviews.
Repo: projects/issuemove/ inside finding-bugs (own repos blocked, see below)
Spec: projects/issuemove/SPEC.md. Research: IDEAS.md round 5.

## Next step

Milestone 1:
- the API client (pagination, errors, Sudo, multipart);
- SOURCE/TARGET parsing;
- `issuemove plan` (a read-only report).

Facts checked on Gitea 1.24.7 (2026-10-15):
- CreateIssueOption, CreateIssueCommentOption and Edit* have no date fields, so
  dates cannot be kept;
- with an admin token the `Sudo` header creates issues, comments, reactions and
  attachments as other users;
- attachments are uploaded as multipart to /issues/{n}/assets (as the Sudo user);
- the timeline endpoint exists.

Forgejo cannot be pulled here (codeberg.org and data.forgejo.org are blocked by the
proxy; the Go proxy only has v1.21). Test Forgejo in GitHub Actions with
codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo. `forgejoclone/forgejo` on Docker Hub is an
unofficial mirror; it is not used.

Gitea test server: `docker run -d --name gt1 -p 127.0.0.1:3001:3000 -e
GITEA__security__INSTALL_LOCK=true -e GITEA__database__DB_TYPE=sqlite3
gitea/gitea:1.24`, then `docker exec -u git gt1 gitea admin user create --admin
...`. Use `--noproxy '*'` with curl for 127.0.0.1.

## Notes for runs

- The Docker daemon is not running at session start. Start it detached with
  `sudo nohup dockerd > /tmp/claude-0/dockerd.log 2>&1 &` and wait a few seconds
  (a plain `&` inside a compound command dies with the shell).
- Integration tests: `MOP_INTEGRATION=1 go test ./...` (label-scoped, safe) or
  `MOP_INTEGRATION=destructive` (unscoped; only on a throwaway daemon like this one).
- The classic image store prunes differently (parent images). To test it, stop
  dockerd and start one with `--feature containerd-snapshotter=false` and a separate
  `--data-root`; the classic-builder tests (DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0) only bite there.
- SeaweedFS quirks found: it lists versions out of key order (verify falls back to
  per-key lookups), guesses Content-Type for application/octet-stream objects in
  unversioned buckets (probe "exact content type"; reported as a change), stores
  "aws-chunked" as Content-Encoding for streaming-signed uploads (copier sends
  plain MD5-checked uploads instead), and needs -volume.max raised for many buckets.
- bucketmove servers: `scripts/test-servers.sh up /tmp/test-servers.env`, then
  `set -a; . /tmp/test-servers.env; set +a; BUCKETMOVE_INTEGRATION=1 go test ./...`.
  MinIO runs with 4 drives (versioning/object lock need erasure coding) and
  MINIO_CI_CD=1. Garage has no versioning, tags, policy, object lock and no
  ListObjectVersions; MinIO has no per-bucket CORS. SeaweedFS and RustFS support all.
- bucketmove test servers: MinIO is not on Docker Hub or reachable registries any
  more; build it with `GOBIN=/tmp/minio-bin go install
  github.com/minio/minio@v0.0.0-20260212201848-7aac2a2c5b7c` (about 2.5 minutes).
  Garage (dxflrs/garage), SeaweedFS (chrislusf/seaweedfs) and RustFS (rustfs/rustfs)
  pull from Docker Hub.
- pushdir tests need rclone: `GOBIN=/tmp/claude-0/rclone-bin go install
  github.com/rclone/rclone@v1.75.2` then `RCLONE_BIN=/tmp/claude-0/rclone-bin/rclone
  make test`. Docker builds here cannot reach the Go proxy: to check the image, copy
  the project to a temp folder, run `go mod vendor`, and build with `-mod=vendor`.
- Docker Hub pulls can fail with 429 (rate limit). Tests must not depend on pulling
  images: build tiny test images locally (e.g. `FROM scratch` with a static file).

## Finished projects

1. **docker-mop** (projects/docker-mop, v1.0.0 at commit 50c1a1e). Docker CLI plugin:
   `plan`/`prune` (exact prune preview, verified against Docker's real prune on both
   image stores) and verified `volume copy`/`rename`. Before making it public the
   owner should: read the README, try `make install` and `docker mop plan` on their
   own machine, check that GitHub Actions ran green on the push, and decide whether
   to give it its own repo (recommended, so `go install` and releases work).
2. **bucketmove** (projects/bucketmove, v1.0.0). Leave MinIO safely: `inventory`,
   `check` (real feature probe + loss report), `copy` (all versions in order, delete
   markers, metadata, tags, locks, settings; crash-safe resume), `verify` (version by
   version with SHA-256). Tested against MinIO, Garage, SeaweedFS and RustFS; two full
   reviews fixed. Owner checks before going public: README, try it against their own
   MinIO with a test bucket, GitHub Actions green.

3. **pushdir** (projects/pushdir, v1.0.0 at commit 9d521f9). Watch a folder and push every change to
   any rclone remote within seconds (rclone#249). Batches with settle checks, filters
   applied by rclone's own rules, opt-in deletions with an hourly budget and
   unmount/empty/replaced-folder guards, hash-checked remote-side renames, retries,
   /status and /metrics, systemd unit, Docker image (checked end to end). Two full
   reviews (data loss; ops/security): 9 + 12 confirmed findings fixed, each with a
   test. Owner checks before going public: README, run it on a real folder for a day,
   try the systemd unit (not tested on a real systemd host), GitHub Actions green.

4. **pgcarry** (projects/pgcarry, v1.0.0 at commit df3dbb4). Safe major-version
   upgrades of Postgres in Docker Compose (docker-library/postgres#37).
   - **Commands:** plan; upgrade (dump from the old server restarted without a
     network, a matching new cluster in a new volume or folder, verified
     inventories, Compose edit by position, a cluster-identity check);
     `--no-switch` rehearsal; rollback (including recovery of a killed run);
     cleanup.
   - **Reviews:** two full reviews and one verification review; 19 + 7 findings
     fixed with tests.
   - **Tests:** Postgres 13–18, Debian/Alpine, pgvector, ICU, binds, user:,
     override files, and interrupts at every step.
   - **Owner checks before going public:** read the README; rehearse on a copy of a
     real app (`--no-switch`); CI green.

## Blockers for the owner

- The finding-bugs repo itself is PUBLIC (seen 2026-10-15). Everything in it
  (projects, logs, research notes) is visible to anyone. The playbook rules forbid
  changing visibility, so the owner decides: make it private (GitHub > Settings >
  Danger Zone), or keep it public knowingly.

- Creating new repos fails: the Claude GitHub app gets "403 Resource not accessible
  by integration". To give docker-mop its own repo, create an empty private repo
  `ganeshphutane-g/docker-mop` on GitHub and give the Claude GitHub app access to it
  (GitHub settings > Applications > Claude > Repository access). The next run will
  move the project there with its history.
- Same for pushdir: an empty private repo `ganeshphutane-g/pushdir` with the Claude
  app given access lets the next run move it there (its README already uses that
  module path for `go install`).
- Pushing git tags is refused by this environment's git proxy (branch pushes work).
  To mark the release, create tag `docker-mop/v1.0.0` on commit 50c1a1e from the
  GitHub web UI (Releases > Draft a new release), or let the run tag it in the new
  repo once it exists.
